# What the Heck is this?

### Learning Goals

* Determine the value of `this` based on how a function is defined and invoked 

- Change the value of `this` within a function using the arrow-function syntax



### Learning Goal 1: Determine the value of `this` based on how a function is defined and invoked

#### Demonstrate:

* That `this` is whatever object the current method belongs to
* That `this` is the current instance, or a "specific" character
* Refactoring our Character class to rely on `this`
* How `this` can change value if the function is made a method of another object

#### Reinforce:

* Critical Analysis: What will the value of `this` be when I reassign a method from Bobby to Eli?

#### Check for Understanding: 

* Kahoot



### Learning Goal 2: Change the value of `this` within a function using the arrow-function syntax

#### Demonstrate:

* Changing our `setInterval` callback to accept an arrow function
* How arrow functions are inherintly bound to whatever `this` was where they were defined 

#### Reinforce:

* Driver / Navigator: Adding the ability to remove a character when it is clicked
  * Make them describe the arrow function syntax!!!

#### Check for Understanding: 

* Kahoot
