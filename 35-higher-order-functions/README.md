# Higher Order Functions



## Learning Goals

- Write more readable code using `map`
- Use callbacks to organize code
- Use currying to organize code



### Values of Functional Programming

- Single Responsibility functions
- Idempotent functions 
- Abstraction through higher order functions
  - Functions that take a function as an argument (callback) or return a function (currying)
