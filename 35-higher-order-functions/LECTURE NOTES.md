# Iterators and Higher Order Functions



## Learning Goals

- Write more readable code using `map`
- Use callbacks to organize code
- Use currying to organize code



### Values of Functional Programming

* Single Responsibility functions
* Idempotent functions 
* Abstraction through higher order functions
  * Functions that take a function as an argument (callback) or return a function (currying)



### Warm Up

* Let's get all of our characters on the screen



### Activation 

* Review of idempotent functions
* Is our createCharacter function idempotent?
* Make it idempotent



### Learning Goal 1: Write more readable code using `map`

* 



### Learning Goal 2: Use callbacks to organize code

* 



### Learning Goal 3: Use currying to organize code

*
