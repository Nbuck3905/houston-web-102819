# Data Structures and Programmatic Thinking

### Learning Goals
- Describe structures with hashes and arrays
- Use `if` to control the flow of your program
- Use `each` to run code for every element in an array
- Define functions



### Activation 

##### 10 minutes

* Tea bag exercise

* List the steps needed to solve the following problem, given a stack of tea bags:

  \* Find the tea that takes the longest to steep

  \* You cannot remember anything



### Learning Goal 1: Describe structures with hashes and arrays

##### 20 minutes

##### Demonstrate 

* Data structures (not Voldemort)
* Difference between normal variables and containers
* Difference between hashes and arrays

##### Vocabulary
- string / symbols / numbers
  - literal values that can be concattenated, shown to users, etc
- hashes
  - containers for other variables
- arrays
  - a container for **unenumerated** elements

##### Check for Understanding
_remember to ask for general questions!_
* Kahoot [1-4]
* Think Pair Share I



### Learning Goal 2: Use `each` to run code for every element in an array

##### 20

##### Demonstrate

- How `if` statements work
- Identifying repetition in solving a problem
- The name of `| x |` doesn't matter! 

##### Vocabulary

- `if/else`
  - a statement which can split the "flow" of your code in two directions
- `each`
  - a tool to cause the same block of code to run multiple times

##### Check for Understanding

_remember to ask for general questions!_

- Kahoot [5-7]
- Self Assessment I



### Learning Goal 3: Create functions

##### 20 min

##### Demonstrate

- Differentiate between **defining** and **invoking**
- Difference between "puts" and "return"
- Names of functions don't really matter
- arguments
  - with and without parenthesis
- hashes as arguments

##### Vocabulary

- function
  - re-useable piece of code
- Single responsibility principle
  - Every function should be responsible for no more than one thing

##### Check for Understanding

_remember to ask for general questions!_

- Kahoot [8-10]
- Self Assessment II



### Learning Goal 4:  Use a methodology to solve problems

##### 20 minutes

##### Demonstrate

* If we break down average, it's really simple since we already have a function for total.
* Questions:
  * What data do I _absolutely_ need to solve the problem?
  * How would I solve the problem with my own hands / mind?
  * What steps could I teach someone else so that they could solve this problem?
  * If there are too many steps, could I break the problem into smaller problems with multiple functions?

##### Check for Understanding
_remember to ask for general questions!_

* Self Assessment III
